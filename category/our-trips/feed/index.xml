					<description><![CDATA[Want to swim with sharks? This trip is for you. We will see tiger sharks, 
hammerheads, lemons and occasionally whale sharks. Not only will you have a thrill 
experiencing silent, graceful beauties swim right by you, you will also learn about the 
importance of sharks. These top-level predators are necessary for a healthy ocean and help 
keep all the other species healthy as well .]]></description>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adrenaline filled amazingness!</h2>



<p>Have you ever thought or dreamed about swimming with an apex predator? If you love sharks<br>this is a fin-tastic experience, you will be able to safely experience the awe and beauty of sharks<br>in the open ocean. Our expert team will keep tabs on you and ensure that you will be<br>completely safe.<br>The warm waters of the Caribbean are home to all kinds of sharks, this trip will allow you to see<br>many different species and the focus of this experience is to educate our guests and help to<br>dispel some of the common stereotypes that many people have when they think of sharks. The<br>waters off the Bahamas are known for nurse sharks, lemon sharks, reef sharks, tiger sharks, as<br>well as the iconic hammerhead shark, depending on the season. And when it comes to getting<br>close to these giant beauties, it pays to book a trip with an outfitter that knows what they’re<br>doing – that would be us!<br>Did you know more people die from taking selfies every year compared to shark attacks? What<br>about driving in a car? flying on a plane? Getting a soda from a vending machine? All of these<br>activities have a higher probability of being injured and/or killed when compared to shark<br>attacks.<br>In an effort to educate people on the true behavior of sharks — often calm and curious, not<br>aggressive — we offer educational experiences that allow people to see firsthand what<br>swimming with them is really like. Our hope is that these experiences may help to clear up any<br>misconceptions and inspire people to advocate for these amazing creatures.<br>Consider joining us for this incredible experience; what makes this trip special is the sheer<br>quantity of sharks; you can dive with as many as 50 at a time — a prospect that is at once both<br>intimidating and awe-inspiring. We will also see lots of other beautiful sea creatures and<br>pristine reefs .</p>

<p>The Galapagos Islands are one of the world’s most spectacular Eden’s of biodiversity. This<br>archipelago is formed of a set of thirteen islands of volcanic origin and more than a hundred<br>islets and rocky outcrops. The Galapagos is a Natural World Heritage Site and Biosphere<br>Reserve, it is known to be the center of the observations and studies of Darwin’s for the<br>development of his “Theory of Evolution”.<br>These diverse volcanic islands are full of mystery and beauty, the wildlife along the Galapagos is<br>endemic to this area and really shows how diversity comes together to create fauna and flora<br>that only exists here.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why is Galapagos so special?</h3>



<p><br>Its exotic landscapes do not resemble other islands of the Pacific at all, they are comprised of<br>huge lava fields, rock formations, cactus forests and volcanic cones, the temperature is quite<br>arid. And this is exactly what makes this uninhabited place seem like it is from another time and<br>planet. Under the sea, there are underground craters and coral reefs, where an extraordinary<br>biological diversity is present. So much so they are also considered one of the seven<br>underwater wonders of the world and one of the most fascinating places in the planet to<br>perform deep sea diving.<br>We will share the rich history of the islands with you, both the geological and natural.

Here you<br>will encounter giant tortoises, land iguanas as well as numerous birds and plant life. Also, on<br>the itinerary we will visit many of the neighboring islands, each one its own eco-system and<br>home to unique animal and plant species. We will spend plenty of time in the water, exploring<br>the beautiful and wonderous scenes and observing wildlife at its finest.<br>Experiencing the Galapagos will strengthen the bond between you and nature. The islands are a<br>very unique place, and when you discover them, it is hard to forget your experiences there .</p>

<p>Learn about coral re-growth and restoration. On this trip, you will work with a team of coral<br>specialists. You’ll see how they grow and care for the coral polyps, and once they are large<br>enough, how each one is meticulously attached to the reef. You will help our team monitor and<br>assess the health of corals at various stages of growth and even be able to attach new coral to<br>help the reef grow!<br></p>
