They are boneless and can squeeze in and out of really<br>tight spaces, they have 3 hearts, blue blood, and 9 brains. They can squirt ink, use tools and<br>instantly change colors and textures. Basically, they are endlessly fascinating.<br>Octopuses come in many sizes, the smallest species is smaller than an inch while the giant<br>pacific octopus can easily grow to be 16 feet long and weigh around 100 pounds. The largest on<br>record was more than 30 feet in length and came in at a whopping 600 pounds. Octopuses live<br>in oceans all over the world but most live near shores and on reefs.<br>One of the coolest things about octopuses is their ability to change color and texture.<br>Octopuses alter their color to hide and match their surroundings. They can turn blue, gray, red,<br>pink, brown or green. Some are able to flex their bodies to resemble more dangerous animals,<br>such as eels and lionfish, and many can change the texture of their skin from smooth to bumpy.<br>They are able to swim by sucking water into their bodies and then shoot it out of their siphons<br>which allows them to blast away from predators, but many prefer to \u2018walk\u2019 or crawl along the<br>seafloor. I have observed an octopus changing its color and texture to mimic kelp where it is<br>difficult to tell the difference between the two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are some cool things about octopuses:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Octopuses have been observed using tools<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>They can change the color of their body in 3\/10\u2019s of a second<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Their suckers are really strong, each sucker can live at least 20x its weight and on<br>average, each arm has 240 suckers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All octopuses contain venom but only the blue-ringed octopus has enough to paralyze<br>an adult in a number of seconds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-id=\"98\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/post-blog-octo05.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-id=\"97\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/post-blog-octo04.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-id=\"96\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/post-blog-octo03.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" data-id=\"95\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/post-blog-octo02.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-id=\"94\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/post-blog-octo01.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Known for their otherworldly, alienish look and incredible intelligence, octopuses<br \/>\ncontinue to reveal astonishing qualities, abilities and behaviors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":99,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/182"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=182"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/182\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/99"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=182"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=182"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/bestwoo\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=182"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
