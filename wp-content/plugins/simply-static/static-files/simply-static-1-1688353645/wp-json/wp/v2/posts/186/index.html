Humans are driving sharks to the brink of extinction at<br>unsustainable rates. By removing sharks from the ocean we threaten a much wider diversity of<br>life.<br>Our oceans need sharks, they are an integral part of the ecosystem, they directly affect the<br>food web and help maintain a healthy ocean ecosystem. For instance, without sharks\u2019 turtles do<br>not move around as much and overgraze in a few locations which quickly destroys these<br>important habitats for many fish, shellfish, and birds. Without sharks, there is an increase of<br>smaller fish that prey on herbivorous fish that graze on algae. With an overgrowth of algae on<br>coral reefs coral growth and biodiversity decrease the resilience of the reef. Sharks help<br>support healthy seagrass meadows by preventing overgrazing and therefore play an important<br>role in the carbon cycle. Seagrass absorbs lots of carbon preventing greenhouse gases from the<br>atmosphere. And sharks help eliminate sick and unhealthy fish from ocean populations, they<br>prey on weaker animals which in turn ensures that the ones that survive and reproduce are the<br>stronger and more healthy fish.<br>Shark finning is decimating the shark population. This gruesome practice of cutting off the<br>shark\u2019s fins and throwing the live animal back into the sea where it dies a slow and painful<br>death. The demand for the status symbol of shark fin soup is driving this craze and the ripple<br>effects are impacting all areas of the ocean. With their slow growth and low reproductive rates,<br>sharks are highly susceptible to extinction, and it is difficult for many shark species to replenish<br>their populations as quickly as they are being diminished. Many species are currently in danger<br>and most have populations that are vulnerable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>it is estimated that 100 million sharks are killed by humans every year, that is about 200 sharks<br \/>\nper minute, 3 sharks a second.
