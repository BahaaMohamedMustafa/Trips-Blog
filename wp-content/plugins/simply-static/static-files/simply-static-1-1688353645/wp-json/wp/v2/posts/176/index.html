Over 80% of the global<br>carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean. The ocean absorbs over 90% of excess heat from<br>greenhouse gas emissions over the past 50 years. Our planet can sustain life because of one<br>universally unique feature: the ocean. It produces half the oxygen we breathe, shapes our<br>weather and climates, provides food for all people and it has to be one of the places that foster<br>inspiration for anyone who lays eyes upon the vastness of the sea. But our marine ecosystems<br>are under attack and not only that but they are woefully underexplored and poorly understood.<br>Climate change is making oceans hotter, promoting acidification, and making it harder for<br>marine life to breathe by reducing dissolved oxygen levels. The ocean is home to millions of<br>marine species, some of who we have yet to even discover yet, this sea contributes to the<br>biodiversity of our planet. How are our actions impacting these lives?<br>We can reduce our own carbon footprint and help decelerate climate change by making smart<br>choices about what we eat and how we travel.<br>Climate change has been called the greatest challenge of our time.
