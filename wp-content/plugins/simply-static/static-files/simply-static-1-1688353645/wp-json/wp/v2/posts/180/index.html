A shark is caught, pulled<br>onboard a boat, its fins are cut off, and the still-living shark is tossed back overboard to drown<br>or bleed to death. The wasteful, inhumane practice is done to satisfy a demand for shark fins,<br>which are in high demand for a luxury soup in Asia with reputable medicinal properties.<br>It has been proven that the shark fins have no nutritional value and are basically tasteless, the<br>flavor of the soup is derived from the broth. The fins are simply added for novelty and status<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the threat to sharks?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finning is responsible for the death of about 100 million sharks every year, that is about 2-3<br>sharks being brutally killed every second! The exact numbers are unknown because in many<br>places and hauls aren\u2019t accurately counted since shark finning is illegal.<br>Because sharks are at the top of the food chain and have few predators, they reproduce and<br>mature slowly. That means their numbers are slow to replenish when a population is<br>overfished. At the rate humans are going, we\u2019re set to wipe out sharks entirely in as little as a<br>decade or so.<br>If sharks are completely eliminated we will have serious problems. Sharks are apex predators<br>and as such, they are invaluable for keeping the populations of everything else in the food chain<br>in balance. The oceans depend on sharks to keep the numbers of other fish and mammal<br>species in check by weeding out the sick, injured, and dying so that populations of fish stay<br>strong and healthy. Without sharks, the balance of the ocean\u2019s food chain is in serious<br>jeopardy.<br>Shark finning is a cruel and dangerous practice, these vital animals are necessary to the<br>ecological balance of our oceans and are about to be wiped out completely<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can you do?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Educate yourself and others about how important sharks are<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Help spread the word about finning<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoid all shark-related products and boycott businesses that sell and serve shark fins<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support marine protected areas<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Urge your senator to support and pass the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 2019<br>Sharks deserve to be swim free and are a vital part of the ocean ecosystem.
